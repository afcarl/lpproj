# Locality Preserving Projections in Python

This is a Python implementation of Locality Preserving Projections (LPP), compatible with scikit-learn.

A basic example can be found in [Example.ipynb](Example.ipynb).

For information on the LPP algorithm, see the paper: [(pdf)](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2359-locality-preserving-projections.pdf)
